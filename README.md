                                                        **CouchPotato(CoPo)**

CouchPotato(CoPo) is an application that allows for show streamers to connect with others for conversation as they watch the same episode of a show.
The goal was to bring back the social experience that came with watch parties and social media conversations as our shows aired on live TV.

                                                          **How it Works**
                                                          
Once a user is logged into their streaming site (Netflix, Hulu, etc), they will connect with our app and select the show, season & episode that they are currently watching. 
Once this has been selected the unique ID provided form the API key will send that user in the matching chat room for that specific show. 
Users who are watching the same episode will be entered into the same chat room since as the APIs will verify and match accordingly.
